# This "raw" playbook provisions an Virtual Machine Instance for use as a 
# temporary trial compile machine. This is useful for test compiling 
# updates to pdf2htmlEX while it is in development.
#
# This playbook uses the *stephengaito/pdf2htmlEX* sources from the HEAD of 
# the *master* branch.
#
# To use another *developmental* fork of pdf2htmlEX, make a *copy* of this 
# playbook and make the appropriate changes.
