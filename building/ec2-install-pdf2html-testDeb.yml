# This "raw" playbook provisions an EC2 Instance for use as a temporary 
# trial installation machine.
#
# NO pdf2htmlEX sources are git cloned onto this machine. This means that 
# this machine knows nothing about pdf2htmlEX.
#
# This means we can use this machine to cleanly install a particluar 
# pdf2htmlEX *.deb release archive.
#
# Use the appropriate pushDebX to push a pdf2htmlEX *.deb release archive 
# to this machine, and then follow the instructions for installation using 
# apt to test the installation.
